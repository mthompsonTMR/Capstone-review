This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://nextjs.org/docs/app/api-reference/cli/create-next-app).


## Getting Started
# Step 1: Initialize Git
git init

# Step 2: README.md with explanation
# Capstone Review: Medical Data ETL & Dashboard

This project is the final capstone for my software engineering training. It integrates a full-stack ETL dashboard and FHIR gateway to process, store, and visualize medical data.

✅ Feature Summary (Capstone Requirements)
This project implements a full-stack medical data dashboard using Next.js App Router, MongoDB, and Context API. The following core requirements were addressed:

✅ Structured folder organization using App Router with (auth) and (private) segments

✅ RESTful CRUD operations for tissue data with replace functionality

✅ Context API for global state management (e.g., uploadStatus) with centralized control (currently tested and under further development )

✅ Authentication scaffolding using route-based access and isAuthenticated state

✅ React-based UI components including dashboard, modals, and search/filter inputs

✅ Integration with backend APIs for dynamic data fetching and updates

✅ Styled using Tailwind CSS for modern and responsive design

✅ Manual validation and error testing completed; automated tests planned

✅ Live deployment on Render with rollback and production-ready structure https://capstone-review.onrender.com/

✅ Documentation maintained via in-project journal and supporting notes

This submission demonstrates an architectural understanding of scalable design, component-based UI, centralized state logic, and real-world debugging and deployment workflows.

## 🔧 Technologies Used

- **Next.js (App Router)** — Frontend & API Routes
- **MongoDB Atlas** — Cloud database for slide, tissue, and patient records
- **AWS S3** — Image and CSV storage integration
- **Tailwind CSS** — Styling
- **Mongoose** — Schema-based MongoDB modeling
- **CSV Upload / Parsing** — For whole slide image and tissue data ingestion
- **FHIR API Gateway** — Mock patient fetch and storage
- **Authentication** — JWT-based or Amplify (pending)

---

## 🚀 Features

- Upload CSV files via UI or URL
- Store parsed data in MongoDB Atlas
- Filter & search slides, tissues, and patients
- Export filtered records to CSV
- Replace or delete existing records via modal
- Fetch mock patients from FHIR server
- Built-in pagination and sorting
- Deployment-ready with `.env` setup

# Step 3: Create a .gitignore
echo "node_modules
.git
*.log
" > .gitignore

# Step 4: Stage the files you want to commit
git add README.md .gitignore

# Step 5: Commit them
git commit -m "Initial commit without tar archive and README"

# Step 6: Add GitHub repo as remote
Clone the repo:
   ```bash
   git clone git@github.com:mthompsonTMR/Capstone-review.git
   cd Capstone-review

   https://github.com/mthompsonTMR/Capstone-review
   

# Step 7: Set branch name and push
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
